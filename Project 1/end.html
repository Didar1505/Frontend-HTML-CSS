        <h3>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)</h3>
    </a>
    <p>If Star Wars gave us a whole new cinematic galaxy, Empire made that galaxy feel so much larger, deeper, and
        richer. Bolstered by the original's success, George Lucas shot for the moon a second time around, teaming up
        with director Irvin Kershner to tell the story of Luke training under Master Yoda, Han and Leia heading to Cloud
        City, and Darth Vader dropping the daddy of all twists. Episode V ramped up the scope with more astonishing
        model work, dizzying dogfights, the snowy Hoth battle, and a ferocious lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader.
        It is, simply, bigger and better than the original Star Wars, influential in its own right with its
        downer-ending and game-changing familial revelations. We love it. You know.</p>

        <h3>The Dark Knight (2008)</h3>
    </a>
    <p>And away… we… go! After constructing a whole new Gotham in Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan introduced the clown
        intent on tearing the whole thing down. Despite being a Batman movie (albeit the first ever not to have 'Batman'
        in the title), The Dark Knight is absolutely The Joker's show – the late, great Heath Ledger (an initially
        controversial choice) putting in a visceral, transformative, truly terrifying performance as the Clown Prince
        Of… not exactly Crime, but pure, unadulterated Chaos. Less than a decade after 9/11, Nolan re-conceived Batman's
        greatest foe as an unpredictable terrorist intent on turning the people of Gotham against each other – his
        actions intended to spark mass discord pulled off in jaw-dropping set-pieces. For all the spectacle, this is a
        very different blockbuster from the off – the genius opening clown-mask bank heist is the film in miniature, an
        ambitious crime saga clad in superhero trappings, daring and ruthless and full of surprises. The Dark Knight is
        full-strength, no-holds-barred, firing-on-all cylinders Nolan, and not just an all-time great comic book movie,
        but an all-time great movie period — as the movie's rightful high ranking here attests.</p>

        <h3>The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring (2001)</h3>
    </a>
    <p>A wizard is never late. Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he... well, you know the rest. It might have
        taken 20 years for Peter Jackson's plucky fantasy to clamber, Mount-Doom-style, to the very pinnacle of our
        greatest-movies pantheon. But here it is, brighter and more resplendent than ever. The Fellowship Of The Ring
        contains so much movie. Even at the halfway point, as the characters take a breather to bicker in Rivendell, you
        already feel sated, like you've experienced more thrills, more suspense, more jollity and ethereal beauty than a
        regular film could possibly muster up. But Jackson is only getting started.</p>

    <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/godfather-review/">
        <h3>The Godfather (1972)</h3>
    </a>
    <p>Stanley Kubrick once described Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel as the best film ever made
        – though having previously topped this list, this time it falls to bronze position. At once an arthouse drama
        and a commercial blockbuster, The Godfather marked the dawn of the age of the mega-movie. An icon of the
        gangster genre, it’s imprinted in popular culture – "Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes", the horse's head in the
        bed – but the first instalment of Brando's cotton-cheeked patriarch's fight for power is so much more than those
        moments. With performances, style and substance to savour, it managed to both smash box office records and live
        on as a staple of cinematic canon.</p>
